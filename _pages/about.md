I am a PhD student at North Carolina State University, 
advised by [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/). 
My research interest lies in the field of Software Engineering
and Security. My past research projects include topics like [Gender Bias in Open Source](), [How Developers Act on Static Analysis Alerts](), and [Exposed Credentials in Shared Source Code](). 
As a first author, my research has been published in top conferences such as ICSE, MSR, and ISSRE. Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research. Please reach out if you are interested in discussing my research, proposing new ideas, or collaborating.
