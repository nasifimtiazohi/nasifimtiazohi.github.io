I am a PhD student at North Carolina State University, 
advised by [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/). 
My research interest lies in the field of Software Engineering
and Security. My past research projects include topics like <i>[gender bias in open source](/projects/gender)</i>, <i>[how developers act on static analysis alerts](/projects/sat)</i>, and <i>[exposed credentials in shared source code](/projects/credscan)</i>. 
As a first author, my research has been published in top conferences such as ICSE, MSR, and ISSRE. Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research. Please reach out if you are interested in discussing my research, proposing new ideas, or collaborating.
